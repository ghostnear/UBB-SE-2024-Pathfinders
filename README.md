## Changes made by group 925/2's Mystic Dragons team to this:

### By the refactoring team:

- Removed a lot of unused code.
- Changed the names of the files and the variables to follow a more natural naming scheme and to respect the specified code style standard.

All of these without changing the core functionality of the app (except that it now doesnt create a random empty file).

### By the testing team:

- Added unit tests on the remaining code.
