## Changes made by group 925/2's Mystic Dragons team to this:

### By the refactoring team:

- Removed a lot of unused code.
- Removed the logger and its' module as it was only created and nothing was written to the created logger.

All of these without changing the core functionality of the app (except that it now doesnt create a random empty file).

### By the testing team:

- Added unit tests on the remaining code.
